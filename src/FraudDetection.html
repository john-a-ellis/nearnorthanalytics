                     <h2>Part 1 Target Variable Review</h2>
                     
                     <p>The dataset consisted of 555718 transaction records of which 2145 were fraudulent (0.3860%).  The labels therefore are highly imbalanced and steps were taken to address the impact of this imbalance on the models.<br>

                     <h2>Part 2 Selection of the objective metric for model assessment</h2>
                     <p>A common metric for machine learning model assessment is accuracy.  However, when dealing with a dataset with a highly imbalanced target variable, relying on accuracy for model assessment can cause issues.</p>
                     <p>Accuracy, as a metric, represents the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. However, when assessing a model’s ability to predict rare positive labels (such as fraudulent transactions), accuracy can be misleading. Why? Because it gives equal weight to both positive (fraudulent) and negative (non-fraudulent) predictions. Let’s illustrate this with an example:</p>
                     <p>Suppose we have a dataset of 100 transactions, with 50 being fraudulent and 50 non-fraudulent. If a model correctly identifies just 90% of the fraudulent transactions (45 out of 50), it achieves an accuracy score of 95%. However, consider a different scenario: a dataset with only 10 fraudulent records and 90 non-fraudulent records. In this case, the model can achieve the same 90% accuracy by correctly identifying all non-fraudulent transactions but completely missing the fraudulent ones.</p>
                     <p>Given that our dataset has, on average, only 1 fraudulent transaction for every 259 transactions observed, using accuracy alone as the performance measure is inadequate. To address this, we turn to balanced accuracy.</p>
                     <p>Balanced accuracy accounts for the class imbalance by considering both positive and negative predictions. It is calculated as the average of two ratios:</p>
                     <p>The correctly predicted fraudulent transactions are divided by all fraudulent transactions (cpf/af).<br>The correctly predicted non-fraudulent transactions are divided by all non-fraudulent transactions (cpnf/anf).<br>Mathematically:</p>
                     <p>Balanced Accuracy = (cpf/af + cpnf/anf) / 2<br>Where:</p>
                     <p>cpf = correctly predicted fraudulent transactions<br>af = all fraudulent transactions<br>cpnf = correctly predicted non-fraudulent transactions<br>anf = all non-fraudulent transactions&quot;</p>
                     <p>Balanced Accuracy is a more appropriate objective metric over accuracy when working with imbalanced classes in the target, as it weighs each sample according to the inverse prevalence of its true class.  It is this metric that is used to assess each model&#39;s performance.</p>

                     <h2>Part 3 Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing</h2>
                     <p>After performing a descriptive analysis of the data some features were dropped or created then encoded/transformed and scaled:   </p>
                     <ol>
                     <li><strong>Dropped Features</strong>: &#39;First&#39; Name, &#39;Last&#39; Name, &#39;cc_num&#39;, &#39;street&#39;, &#39;city&#39;, &#39;state&#39;, &#39;dob&#39;, &#39;Trans_num&#39;, &#39;Unix_time&#39;, &#39;Lat&#39;, &#39;Long&#39;, &#39;Merch_lat&#39;, &#39;Merch_long&#39;.  The personal identification data was dropped as we didn&#39;t want it to influence the analysis, we tried to find the fraudulent customer without knowing their exact ID.  Transaction features like Trans_num, and Unix_Time were also dropped as they do not correlate to the inci2ence of fraud.  </li>
                     <li><strong>Created Features</strong>:</li>

                     <p>The logistic regression model as illustrated above has a mediocre performance when attempting to predict the fraudulent records in the test set as evidenced by the recall of 0.05 where approximately 1 in every 20 fraudulent transactions were detected.  This low performance is further illustrated by the 0.52 balanced accuracy score achieved.  Based on this result we moved on to a non-linear model.</p>

                     <p>The non-linear Support Vector Machine model with the non-linear radial bias activation function performs marginally better than the logistic regression function.  It yields a 0.10 improvement in the balanced accuracy score and a 5-fold improvement in model recall.  However the model is only able to detect 25% of the fraudulent transactions.  </p>

                     <p>The XGBoost model with its ability to accept a &#39;scale_pos_weight&#39; parameter helps compensate for the class imbalance in the target variable.  As a result, it performs much better at detecting fraudulent transactions than the other algorithms considered.  The parameter <a href="Footnotes:">2</a>&#39;scale_pos_weights&#39; is set to the ratio of negative transactions to positive transactions. (sum(negative_y)/sum(positive_y)) or 259.0 which when applied removes the imbalance in the target label during model fitting.</p>
                     <p>Note robustness of the XGBoost algorithm is evident when reviewing the relative importance of the features applied.  XGBoost can reduce the impact of a feature to zero or nearly zero which can assist the scientist with feature engineering.</p>

                     <p>The tuned model exhibited significant improvement in balanced accuracy (0.03) when evaluated against the test dataset, surpassing the base XGBoost model. Notably, it demonstrated heightened sensitivity to fraudulent transactions compared to all other reviewed models. However, this performance gain came at the cost of precision: 84% of the predicted fraudulent transactions were false positives, representing a 22% increase from the base model. Importantly, this translated to only 2% of legitimate transactions being incorrectly flagged as fraudulent.</p>

                     <h2>Comparative Feature Importance by Model</h2>
                     <p>In our review of ensemble models, one consistent finding is that the log_amount of the transaction stands out as the most significant feature across all models. However, beyond this consistency, the importance of other features varies significantly from model to model. Notably, both the XGBoost Base Model and the XGBoost BEST model share several features that rank high in importance. To explore further, we could consider excluding some of the less significant features from the XGBoost BEST Model and assess whether this refinement leads to improved performance.<br>

                     <h2>Final Conclusions</h2>
                     <p>XGBoost, with its capability to adjust the weight of the positive target coupled with using balanced accuracy as the objective performance metric, serves as an effective framework for building binary classification models. This framework is particularly well-suited for classifying datasets with highly imbalanced target classes.</p>
